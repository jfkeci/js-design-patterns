1. Single Responsibility Principle
- A class should only have one reason to change
- Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

2. Open-Closed principle
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

3. Liskov Supstitution Principle
- you should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

4. Interface Segregation Principle
- Don't put too mutch into an interface;
  - Split into separate interfaces
- YAGNI - You Ain't Going To Need It
  - You ain't going to need certain methods so why force devs to implement them

5. Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-Level modules should not depend upon low-level ones
- Use apstractions
