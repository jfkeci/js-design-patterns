- Design patterns are tipically split into three categories
- This is called Gamma Categorization

- Creational patterns
  - Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
  - Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
  - Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

- Structural Patterns
  - Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
  - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class or interface
  - Stress the importance of good API design

Behavioural Patterns
- They are all different
- No central theme
