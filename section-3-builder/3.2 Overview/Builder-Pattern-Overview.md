# Builder pattern

- Some objects are simple and can be created in a single initializer call
- Other object require a lot of ceremony to create
- Having an object with 10 initializer arguments is not productive
- Instead, opt for piecewise construction

### DEFINITION
- Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step
- When piecewise object construction is complicated provide an API for doing it succintly
