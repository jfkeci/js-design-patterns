# Bridge Overview

## Motivation

Bridge prevents a 'cartesian product' (mathematical operation that returns a set from multiple sets) complexity explosion
Example: 
- base class ThreadScheduler
- Can be preemptive or cooperative
- Can run on Windows or Unix
- End up with a 2x2 scenario: WindowsPTS, Unix PTS, WIndowsCTS, UnixCTS
