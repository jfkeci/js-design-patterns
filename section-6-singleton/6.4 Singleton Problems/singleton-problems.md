# Singleton Problems

Singletons, while useful in some scenarios, have several potential problems:
1. **Global State**: Singletons often represent a global state in your application and global state is generally considered bad because it can make the system harder to reason about.
2. **Hidden Dependencies**: If a class depends on a Singleton, this dependency is often not clear from its API. The Singleton is usually accessed directly rather than being passed in as a parameter.
3. **Difficulty in Testing**: Singletons can make unit testing difficult because they make it hard to isolate classes to be tested. Since singletons carry state along with them, tests can become order-dependent and fail or pass unexpectedly.
4. **Concurrency Issues**: If multiple threads can access the singleton at the same time, you may encounter race conditions.
5. **Restricts Code Evolution**: If you decide that a Singleton should no longer be a Singleton, refactoring the code can be difficult, especially if the Singleton has been widely used.

In the provided code, the test "is a singleton" is expecting the MyDatabase class to be a Singleton. However, as it's currently written, MyDatabase is not a Singleton because each new MyDatabase() is creating a new instance of the class. To make it a Singleton, you would need to ensure that only one instance of MyDatabase can be created.
