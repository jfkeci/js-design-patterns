# Singleton Summary

A constructor can choose what to return
- we can keep returning the same instance

Monostate
- Multiple instances, shared data
- This implementation is dangerous for a number of reasons

Problems
- Directly depending on the Singleton is a bad idea
- Introduce a dependency instead
